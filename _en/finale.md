We have come a long way since `console.log('hello, world')` in [the first lesson](../basics/).
Callbacks and promises,
JSON and web servers,
packaging, unit tests, and visualization:
every modern language can do them,
but JavaScript is an increasingly popular choice.
Yes,
it has its flaws,
but if we avoid some of its [legacy features](../legacy/),
it's both usable and powerful.

Our journey doesn't stop here, though.
The appendices explore some next steps,
such as [logging what our server does](../logging/)
and [using a relational database](../database/) instead of a text file
as a data store.
Beyond that,
you could look at using the full power of the [D3](FIXME) library for interactive visualization,
or at building more sophisticated React interfaces with [RxJS](FIXME).
Whatever you do,
we hope that this tutorial has helped you get started.
