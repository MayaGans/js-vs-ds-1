I was originally going to call this book *JavaScript for Scientists and Engineers*,
but [David Beazley thought that "versus" would make a better title]({{site.data.links.beazley_tweet}}).
That one-word change sums up how many people view the language,
but I hope I can convince you that modern JavaScript is usable as well as useful.
I also changed the second half of the title in the hope that
this guide will help librarians,
digital humanists,
and everyone else who uses computing in their research,
not just scientists and engineers.
