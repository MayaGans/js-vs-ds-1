The collection, availability, and  analysis of data now influences almost every aspect
of modern life and the importance of data is likely only to increase for the foreseeable
future. Concurrently and for many of the same reasons, the importance of "traditional" media
is being undermined and replaced by online platforms. It is vital that those with the skills 
to extract knowledge from data are also able to publish those insights and the accompanying 
data online.

Aided by easily-accessible tools and learning resources for modern programming languages such as
R and Python, data scientists have gained many of the skills necessary to handle, analyse, and 
interpret data sets. However, there exist considerably fewer resources that can help them to
independently and quickly publish their data and present their results on the web in such a way
that enables their target audience to find, interrogate, and interpret it. 
This book is an attempt to bridge the gap between data science and web publishing.

As our lives are spent online, JavaScript is becoming the one unavoidable programming language 
for scientists, engineers, librarians, digital humanists, and anyone else using computing in 
their research. *JavaScript versus Data Science* introduces the reader to this powerful and 
ideosyncratic language, guiding them through the key features of modern JS and the tools and 
libraries required to serve data to the browser, then present, explore, and interact with it. 
The book places equal focus on both client- and server-side programming, providing the reader
with an introduction to generating interactive web content, building and testing data
services, and visualizing data in the browser.
