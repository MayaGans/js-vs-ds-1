Collecting and analyzing data is now as important to research as telescopes and test tubes,
and the importance of data is only going to increase.  At the same time, traditional print
media are being supplanted by dynamic online delivery.  Researchers who can turn data into
insight need to be able to publish their discoveries and the data that back them up online.

This book is an attempt to bridge the gap between data science and web publishing.  It uses
JavaScript because it is the one unavoidable language for sharing, reporting, visualizing,
and interacting online.  *JavaScript versus Data Science* introduces readers to its power
and ideosyncracies, guiding them through the key features of modern JavaScript and the tools
and libraries needed to serve data to the browser and then present, explore, and interact with
it. The book places equal focus on both client- and server-side programming, and introduces
the reader to generating interactive web content, building and testing data services, and
visualizing data in the browser.
